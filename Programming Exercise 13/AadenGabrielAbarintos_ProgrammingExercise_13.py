# AadenGabrielAbarintos_ProgrammingExercise_13.py
# This program creates a database called population_AA
# then creates a table within that database with the fields
# city, year, and population. The data is composed of
# ten cities within the state of Florida from the year 2023. 
# The program then simulates population growth and decline 
# for the next 20 years. Then the program shows the 
# population growth for a city. The user then is prompted
# to select a city to display the data.
